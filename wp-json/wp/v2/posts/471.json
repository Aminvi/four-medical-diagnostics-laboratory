The treatments are designed to boost the immune system&#8217;s response or help it recognize cancer cells more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stimulating the Immune Response:<\/strong>&nbsp;Immunotherapy can enhance the body\u2019s natural immune response to cancer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Targeting Cancer Cells:<\/strong>&nbsp;By identifying specific markers on cancer cells, immunotherapy can help the immune system target and destroy them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reducing Immune Suppression:<\/strong>&nbsp;Some cancers produce substances that suppress the immune system. Immunotherapy can counteract this suppression and restore immune function.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full image-file\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"833\" height=\"522\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details2-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-953\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details2-1.webp 833w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details2-1-300x188.webp 300w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details2-1-768x481.webp 768w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details2-1-530x332.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full image-file\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"834\" height=\"522\" src=\"https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-954\" srcset=\"https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details3.webp 834w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details3-300x188.webp 300w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details3-768x481.webp 768w, https:\/\/themes.hibootstrap.com\/limpid\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/10\/blog-details3-530x332.webp 530w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges and Future Directions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>epresents a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer, offering new hope and improved outcomes for many patients.
